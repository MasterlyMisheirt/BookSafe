reading list.

- Distinct read/reading/to-read categories
- More customisation for books and book groups
- Allow books to belong to multiple book groups

## Questions & Answers

### What is the Google Books API used for?

**BookSafe** integrates with the API to automatically retrieve book details via a simple UI. Users can enter a book
title or include an author to refine the search, and the fields will populate with the first matching result.
